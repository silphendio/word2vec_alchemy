# word2vec_alchemy
Merging words with word2vec embeddings in pure javascript

The embeddings are used in as a word => embedding map.

Embeddings are downloaded from [https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/]
then filtered down to words from [https://www.desiquintans.com/nounlist].

The result is then converted to json.
